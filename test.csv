61,2021-07-11 22:20:04+00:00,"@lyricistrs it’s already happening, england fans already flooded saka ig comments with a monkey emoji.",TEYOCHIE
72,2021-07-11 23:51:10+00:00,never fear saka and rashford and sancho get behind me I will be your protector from old white men on twitter,scrunkieberg
73,2021-07-11 23:50:48+00:00,"@Niahp0Oh because brits think that the way that rashford, sancho, and saka missed was because of their skin colour (well indirectly, but its linked to how theyre falsely perceived to be sub-human or inferior in skill to white ppl)",thepropork
78,2021-07-11 23:40:56+00:00,"I just know rashford, sancho, and saka will be facing vile racist abuse for their penalty misses by the white brits",iDontexist_bot
90,2021-07-11 23:33:10+00:00,"its sad though bc sterling is the sole reason for england to come this far in the euros but he’s gonna be overshadowed by the white man that is harry kane. now sancho, rashford and saka are being blamed for losing the euros when its the white man that is southgate to blame for it",theebushy
105,2021-07-11 23:22:13+00:00,@UpDaChelsea @Ajay307_7 @sarajbz @UTDTrey It was mount who let Italy score in the first place but no one talking about that but saka rashford and sancho getting blame for missing a penalty because their not white 🤷‍♂️ but your a bias fan so you won’t see that,PrinceA51800613
106,2021-07-11 23:22:07+00:00,@Glenn_Lowts34 in my opinion lad England need a better manager to be honest Southgate to negative and does not know what he’s doing half the time and my argument is why didn’t he never start grealish why didn’t he give Calvert lewin a go saka many chances Ben white Reece James,Lukedegilbert2
110,2021-07-11 23:19:54+00:00,@Juknzd1 @YoDuuh91 @Froste Bruh you know what fans england has. It’s worse for saka missing the pen than kane. The white ppl are gonna be racist asf. And yes manager is to blame but if someone had to miss the penalty it would’ve been better if it was a white person and not black,ArMachine16

145,2021-07-11 22:59:03+00:00,people who are blaming saka for the loss why the fuck are you not blaming the white manager who thought it was fucking okay to put a inexperienced 19 year old to take the deciding penalty you all are a fucking joke,raphalichas
152,2021-07-11 22:57:06+00:00,"Anyone being racist toward saka needs to fucking realise either black or white, yellow or blue would have felt the pressure the nation on their shoulders, take a hard look at yourself and tell me you would have scored that pen",wagman_harry
156,2021-07-11 22:55:26+00:00,i’m the same age as saka &amp; i could never even imagine the amount of pressure he was under. give the guy a fucking break. this will stick with him for the rest of his career &amp; he doesn’t need fucking middle aged white men who can’t even play football making it worse for him,NIALLSOTB
164,2021-07-11 22:52:14+00:00,oh my god Italian fans are using saka being choked and pulled down as a meme??? A black teenager being pulled to the floor by your entirely white team and not getting a red card for it is a JOKE to you???? smells racist to me.... absolutely vile,dontg0dark

174,2021-07-11 22:48:02+00:00,@huxiyi no you’re so so right and like if chiellini had blatantly attacked a white player like he did saka there’s not a chance in hell the ref would’ve still given just a yellow card.. that was the most blatant red card in the tournament. just horrifying behavior all around,lezbichen
182,2021-07-11 22:43:52+00:00,"What is this racism thing. People of color brought England to the finals sterling, saka was your best players. whole squad is immigrants of color you should all be grateful for them. What did the white English men do.
